This is a script to migrate [emailrelay](http://emailrelay.sourceforge.net/) from SVN to git.

It uses [svn-all-fast-export](https://github.com/svn-all-fast-export/svn2git) and a synced copy of the SVN repository to do its work.

You can find the continuously updated repo resulting from this script here:

[aclemons/emailrelay](https://github.com/aclemons/emailrelay)
